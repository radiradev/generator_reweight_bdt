# Generator Reweighting of DUNE event samples
This repository provides a python interface to a trained BDT for reweighting between GENIEv2 and GENIEv3_10b using [cppyy](https://github.com/wlav/cppyy). 

# What is this repo about   
Reweighting distributions using a BDT. More info on the methodology in this [presentation](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/47708/contributions/208129/attachments/139833/175623/cv_generatorrw_20210208.pdf)
